# OPEN-JJBA
An open source JJBA game.

## About
Open JJBA is written in [Typescript (via Roblox-TS)](https://roblox-ts.com) and uses the [Matter](https://eryn.io/matter/docs/intro/) library. Before contributing code, it is good to get familiar with both. 

## Licensing
The project itself uses [reuse](https://reuse.software/) to specify the used licenses. More information (including the copyright holders) can be found in the individual files.

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome. You can check our [Issues](https://github.com/void-starred/openjjba/issues) to see feature requests and bugs. The owners of the void-starred organization hold final decision on what gets added to the game, however, you are free to maintain your own fork if you want to add a feature we didn't.
In the future, there will be a CONTRIBUTING.md, which will outline the process to contribute code, models, animations, and UI.
