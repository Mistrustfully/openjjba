# OPEN-JJBA
An open source JJBA game.

## About
Open JJBA is written in [Typescript (via Roblox-TS)](https://roblox-ts.com) and uses the [Matter](https://eryn.io/matter/docs/intro/) library. Before contributing code, it is good to get familiar with both. 
This project is also licensed under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html) (see [COPYING](https://github.com/void-starred/openjjba/blob/main/COPYING)). Essentially that means:
- If you distribute this project (ex. As a game), you *must* disclose source.
- All distributions must have the *same license*.
- Changes to the project must be *stated* (However, using [git](git-scm.com), this process is automated for you).

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome. You can check our [Issues](https://github.com/void-starred/openjjba/issues) to see feature requests and bugs. The owners of the void-starred organization hold final decision on what gets added to the game, however, you are free to maintain your own fork if you want to add a feature we didn't.
In the future, there will be a CONTRIBUTING.md, which will outline the process to contribute code, models, animations, and UI.
