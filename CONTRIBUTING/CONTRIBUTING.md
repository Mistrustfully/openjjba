All contributions must be [REUSE](https://reuse.software) compatiable. Generally, you should license game logic under `GPL-3.0-or-later`, and generic code under `MIT`. Assets should be licensed under `GPL-3.0-or-later`.  Whenever you modify a file, it is important to add your name to the header of the file / the file's `.license`.

It is recommended to use the [REUSE Helper Tool](https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/tool) to add headers to your files.

## Toolings
These are the tools you will need to have installed to contribute.
